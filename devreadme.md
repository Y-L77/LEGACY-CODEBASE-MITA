TECH STACK:
up to developers discretion but we using KaTex for the latex rendering on HTML.
make sure no important niches so collaboration is simple and scalable & not difficult to integrate


2025/08/14, I've (yipeng) already made a sleek canvas that will be similar to the final product.
Rhythm has made the landing page, I'll leave it for him to integrate in my component of the code


(FUTURE) => in somewhat order of what to do first and last

-polishing homepage with math/MITA themes including not limited to pictures, images, SFX, ETC

-adding QoTM (instead of puzzles) refer to evil skribbles or cemc QoTW for nice problem examples

-adding latex form keyboard instead of mouse (refer to desmos i like their typecasting)

-Polishing actual game loop, making sure questions cycle properly, adding questions to question pool, making sure the canvas has good user experience, getting the singleplayer launch ready.

-dynamic elo and customized elo equation that scales and works well.

-adding winstreaks + an elo enhancement multiplier for streaks e.g x10% more elo per 5 cosnecutive wins

-customizing user profile with profile pictures, descriptions, etc. refer to DMOJ to see profile features e.g school, country, etc.

-credits page, developer title, description, socials, face (or pfp to dev's discretion), with credit on inspired questions list and images of contests or work that gave inspiration (rhythm pls add the chinese trig work)

-leaderboards

-our own lesson (premium feature for moitization on the learn)

-polishing the user experience more, always.

-adding realtime duels and multiplayer competitive.

-adding an anticheat (MAKE SURE doesn't sacrifice user experience. keep reports and real mods and proctors as the main option to serve punishment.)

-maybe set up mathplotlib or something similar to show statistics and elo over time like chess.com

-we should probably keep statistics e.g ratio of calculus questions solved and failed as a premium feature. (keep everything free v1 of launch)



-TASK DELEGATION (VERY subject to change, written as of 2025/08/15 2:26AM)

-rhythm's development to his discretion based on the doc above.
-i will set up mini development team to write up math contest questions.


DEV NOTE:
don't reorder my questions.json by difficulty. you can reorder it in a .md file.
The questions will be ordered by id, note the id on the elo ordered md for ease of change
